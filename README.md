# Docker PHP images
Docker images built on top of the [official PHP images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) with the addition of some common and useful extensions.

This project is based on [Chialab's source](https://github.com/Chialab/docker-php).

PHP extensions installed with [mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer).

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed globally in all images. Please, refer to their documentation for usage hints.

An automated build is set up, so they should be always up-to-date with the Dockerfiles in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/m0bua/hub-docker-php).

You can find these images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/m0bua/php).
